Current state of work:

incomplete - Some work has been done, but the process and even the structure
is not yet complete or solved.

complete - The process is complete but not yet compiled. Since it is not yet
compiled, there are minor things like wrong structure names or missing simple
functions. These remaining issues will be solved by trying to compile.
So complete does mean that there is no more 'brain' requied.

compiled - The code has been compiled, but not yet tested.
