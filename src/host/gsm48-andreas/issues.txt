Location updating procedure:

When SIM is "NOT UPDATED", there is no valid LAI in SIM. LOCATION UPDATING
REQUEST message requires LAI. How is an IMSI attach possible, if no LAI
exists?
We have three conditions:
- LAI in SIM is valid
- LAI in SIM exists (last stored) but marked invalid.
- No LAI in SIM (brand new one)
See Table 10.5.3 TS 04.08 and try to understand the riddle...


OpenBSC:
If tx_setup fails during process, the msg must be freed to avoid memory leak.


OpenBSC:
Must use *_LOC_PRN_S_LU on protocol side.
Or it uses *_LOC_PUN_S_LU to hide private network type (maybe some cfg option)


LCR:
Also LCR must use correct location.
For MS support, it must use *_LOC_USER


Measurements:
How do we send MEASUREMENT RESULTS to RSL? (maybe RSL_MT_MEAS_RES)
what triggers the sending? Or do we just send it from time to time to layer 1
where it is stored and sent when the time is right? (Then we might get
something like RSL_MT_MEAS_CNF, so we can send the next one, if we have new
measurements available, otherwhise the L1 will use the old measurement results
and resends them without confirming it.)


RACH:
I need some RACH primitives like:
- RACH request (tx_ph_rach_req already exists) including value and offset of
  RACH slot from now.
- RACH confirm, the RACK has been sent (with timeslot where is was sent)
- RACH cancel request:
  Since RACH request must be queued in layer 1 until it the right slot is
  reached, I need to tell L1 to cancel it. Whenever I receive a confirm, I
  schedule the next one until the maximum number has been transmitted or until
  an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT is received on CCCH.
Any better idea? Read GSM 04.08 clause 3.3.1.1.2 and 3.3.1.1.3 for more info.


RACH request on RSL:
Does it make sense to put RACH request to the set of RSLms primitives?
(i.e. RSL_MT_CHAN_REQ, not RQD!, RSL_MT_CHAN_CNF, RSL_MT_CHAN_CAN)
What do you say?


I need to change storage of system informations when searching other cells.
I prefer two modes:
- collecting all SI on serving cell, collecting only relevant data of other cell
- collecting all SI on serving cell and other cells, storing them for each
  frequency (netmonitor)

How do I (radio ressource) know about the channel layout on BCCH? This info is
requred to select correct delays and timings.
-> i think i got it from system informations^


How do I return after L1CTL_DM_EST_REQ back to idle mode?
Using l1ctl_tx_ccch_req?

mncc.h of openbsc / layer23:
What about putting all (except call structure) to osmocore?

bsic???????

How do I stop scanning frequencies?
The scanning process may currently restart scanning, when process is running.
