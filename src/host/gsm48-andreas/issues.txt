Location updating procedure:

When SIM is "NOT UPDATED", there is no valid LAI in SIM. LOCATION UPDATING
REQUEST message requires LAI. How is an IMSI attach possible, if no LAI
exists?


OpenBSC:
If tx_setup fails during process, the msg must be freed to avoid memory leak.

OpenBSC:
Must use LOC_PRN_S_LU on protocol side.
Or it uses LOC PUN_S_LU to hide private network type (maybe some cfg option)

LCR:
Also LCR must use correct location.
For MS support, it must use LOC_USER
